 development process of Final Fight was within a couple of months. It 
started off with nailing down the type of game I wanted to make. Since 
I've always been interested in fighting games, particularly Super Smash 
Bros., I wanted to develop a game that had a similar aesthetic and feel.
 To accomplish that, I took a simple approach as to keep within the 
small scope of the project. Having a smaller project scope also allowed 
me to learn many of the fundamentals in both game development and game 
design, as this was my first project. With that, I knew I wanted to make
 it 2D sprite-based game as that what I was most familiar with, but also
 fit with the style that I was going for. I then started doing research 
on how to develop, design, and create a simple platformer game, just as a
 base to build from. After figuring out what sort of game I wanted to 
create and having tested the base platformer game, I took it upon myself
 to familiarize myself more with the Unity 2D engine and ways I can 
utilize it. This is where I self-taught myself some fundamentals of 
Unity 2D. Using the base platformer, I learned and understood the 
physics engine and tweaked it to what fit best for a platform fighter. I
 made it a bit floatier while keeping with the faster pace of the 
fighting game genre. I then moved onto the attacking, which was 
barebones for this project, as the characters only have one attack. 
Setting up hitboxes, instancing damage areas to match with the swing 
animation, UI/UX, and developing an HP system were all part of my 
learning experience.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="Final%20Fight%20-%20Daniel%20Alcala%20-%20Portfolio_files/underwater.png" alt=""></span>One
 of the most exciting parts of development was the level design. I 
wanted each level to feel different, as well as match the aesthetic and 
theme of each one. The first level, the forest level, was a level I had 
in mind as a starter level. It was going to be as neutral as possible 
without anything crazy. The level design was like that of Battlefield 
from Super Smash Bros., it’s an iconic level that is designed to be as a
 starter for any player or character. With the base level out of the 
way, I wanted to experiment a bit on two different fronts with the other
 levels, on the theme/art of the level, and the actual level design. The
 city level, my second level, was my take on changing up the theme and 
art a bit and having something that felt different from the other 
levels. I did change the map design somewhat, but overall, the feel of 
the level was very similar to the forest. The final level, the ocean 
level, was my most radically changed level. In this one, I wanted to 
change everything, from the level design to the art. I was set on an 
underwater ocean styled level as it felt the most interesting, and not 
particularly common, place to hand a fighting game. The level layout was
 also drastically different, where instead of being Battlefield 
inspired, I took an approach that seemed fun for both players. I wanted 
to make the level has a center area where the players have constant 
battles or control of the area. As well as platforms for them to retreat
 to or make outplays in. It is also an asymmetrical map, so the 
playstyle will feel a bit more unique than the others.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="Final%20Fight%20-%20Daniel%20Alcala%20-%20Portfolio_files/city.png" alt=""></span>Although
 I felt extremely proud of the levels, there were some areas in which 
there is room for improvement. Some game mechanic systems, like a time 
limit or special moves, would’ve helped make the game feel a lot more 
unique. I also did not get to implement sound design in the game as the 
deadline was too close for it. Finally, as this was my first-time using 
animation in Unity, I encountered many weird bugs, including where all 
the animations would play backwards for the second player. This game was
 a big learning experience for getting me familiar with Unity and game 
development as whole. I learned about how to pace myself and what to 
focus on when a timeline and project scope is required, which carried 
into my future projects.</p>
